# The Investing Trail

### Core Concept

The objective the app is to provide a realistic investment experience 
within a short and fun time frame. The user will be given a set of
circumstances from the outset of the game (such as salary and beginning year) and will have
a limited ability to make investment related decisions. All investment
data will be real based on the given time frame. 

### Back-End

* Make sure Python is installed. Your machine likely comes with python 2.7 but we'll be using 3.6 in our virtualenv
* install pip
* install virtualenv
* install virtualenvwrapper
* install pyramid

`mkvirtualenv investing-trail`
`pip install requirements.txt`

You might need to do something special with virtualenvwrapper in order
to get it to use python3 as the virtualenv.

Also, make sure that it's totally cool to use python3 with pyramid.
Seems like by now that should be possible.
